3. ABSTRACT
The Shopping Cart Program is a console-based application developed in Python that simulates the basic functionality of an online shopping cart. WE can browse products, add items to the cart, view the cart, remove items, calculate the total bill with GST, and generate a final receipt.
The project demonstrates core programming concepts such as lists, dictionaries, loops, functions, file handling, and exception handling.

4. OBJECTIVES
